# Chapter 1

Here are my notes so far. EVERYTHING is fair game, so use what is useful and change
what you need.

## Characters

A band of dwarves. Five of them are focus of the story (four, plus the player character.)
The other dwarves may be present to make the game world feel alive. One of them is very
strong, lovable and brave, this is the one that we kill.

The Wyrums. A bunch of slimy and chitinous dark-dwelling worm creatures. They are generally
not hostile, but become aggrivated.

### Note: Dwarf Names

I'm tempted to just randomly generate some dwarf names as needed:

- Burli
- Frorror
- Thornri
- Thrain

## Game Zones

These are the "zones" where all of the gameplay in the first chapter will go down.
They're listed here somewhat in the order of their appearance, but this is not totally
indicative of the structure of the story/gameplay experience. For instance, many of
these zones will be revisited several times in a different context throughout the
first chapter.

The whole first chapter takes place underground in a mine owned by a small but
powerful dwarf clan.

1. Tavern

A warm tavern with a trap door to a cellar bellow.

2. Tavern Way

A winding path through the mines which connects the tavern to the hovels and the deepmine.

3. Fork

A threeway fork in the road with the tavern to the left, hovels to the right, and
the deepmine below.

4. Hovels

A collection of homesteads.

5. Descent to Mine

A long staircase leads to an elevator, which terminates in a large room containing the
gate to the deepmine.

6. Wyrum Prince's Makeshift Tunnel

A long, claustrophobic shaft left by the Wyrum Prince madly tunneling up into the 
deepmine antechamber from his lair below.

7. Wyrum Lair

A vast room the was the burrow and resting place of the Wyrum prince and his brood.

8. Player's Hovel

A cozy home.

### Note: The "Deepmine"

This is where the dwarves generally go to extract wealth from the mountain.
This area is closed and is not playable, but it's a concept that all the dwarves
are very familiar with.
